# Crop Yield Prediction
This code implements machine learning models to predict crop yields based on agricultural parameters. Agriculture plays a crucial role in global food security and sustainable development, heavily influenced by weather conditions such as rainfall. Accurate forecasting of crop yields is essential for effective agricultural planning and decision-making. In this context, machine learning models offer a promising approach for predicting crop yields, leveraging datasets containing information on crops, seasons, states, and agricultural practices. The code utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor models to predict crop yields. These models are trained and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess their performance. Ultimately, accurate crop yield prediction can contribute to optimizing agricultural practices, ensuring food security, and fostering sustainable agricultural development.

# Features in the dataset may include:

- Crop: The type of crop being cultivated.
- Crop_Year: The year in which the crop was harvested.
- Season: The season during which the crop was cultivated (e.g., Kharif, Rabi, Whole Year).
- State: The state where the crop was grown.
- Area: The area of land used for cultivating the crop. (In Hectares)
- Production: The quantity of crop produced. (In metric tons)
- Annual_Rainfall: The annual rainfall in the region where the crop was cultivated. (In mm)
- Fertilizer: The amount of fertilizer used in cultivation. (In Kgs)
- Pesticide: The amount of pesticide used in cultivation. (In Kgs)
= Yield: The yield of the crop. (Production per unit area)
